# Pre-AP Computer Science: Web Development
Welcome to our course website! ðŸ’»

### Course Description
> The goal of the Pre-AP Computer Science course is to build a foundation in creative UI design and computational thinking through the exciting lens of Website Development. Students review web design with `HTML` and `CSS`, dive into advanced `CSS` styling techniques, and learn to implement industry-standard tools like `Bootstrap` for Responsive Design. `JavaScript` is also introduced in the context of creating interactive webpages, dynamic web applications, and browser games. Students emerge from the Pre-AP course equipped with an understanding of their potential impact within the field of technology, proficiency in three complementary coding languages, and the ability to code fully-functional, interactive websites.
