# Intro Computer Science: Web Development
Welcome to our course website! ðŸ’»

### Course Description
> The Intro Computer Science course introduces students to programming with a special emphasis on Website Development. By engaging with current technologies, students enhance their creativity, critical thinking abilities, and problem-solving skills in a context that is highly relevant and applicable. The first semester is dedicated to static website creation, where students learn to build the structure of pages using HTML, style them with CSS, and enhance functionality by leveraging popular toolkits like Bootstrap. Each student designs and codes their own multi-page personal website that is mobile-responsive, user-friendly, and has a cohesive aesthetic. In the second semester, students enhance their HTML pages by integrating JavaScript (JS), a powerful programming language that enables dynamic behavior, user interaction, and data processing. Time permitting, industry-standard JS libraries like React and Node.js are explored. Throughout the year, the class engages in meaningful discussions about the legal, social, and ethical issues surrounding internet-based technology in modern society. Students emerge from the Pre-AP course equipped with an understanding of their potential impact within the field of technology, proficiency in three complementary coding languages, and the ability to code fully-functional, interactive websites.
