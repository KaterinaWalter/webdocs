### Course Description
> The goal of the Pre-AP Computer Science course is to build a foundation in creative **User Interface (UI)** design and computational thinking through the exciting lens of **Website Design & Development**. Students review static website creation with `HTML`, dive into advanced `CSS` styling techniques, and learn to implement industry-standard tools like `Bootstrap` for **Responsive Design**. The programming language `JavaScript` is also introduced in the context of creating interactive webpages, dynamic web applications, and browser games.
