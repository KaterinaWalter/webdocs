### Overview & Setup

It's time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished, unless you're into [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/), that is.

{:.highlight}
It's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 1.1` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the link to the **HTML/CSS/JS** template.
2. üìÅ Click `Use This Template` then select `Create New Repository`
3. Name your repository: `CS1-Project-1-1-YourUsername`
4. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
5. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository page** in the `CS1 Project 1.1` assignment on Blackbaud.

<!-- WAS HAVING ISSUES WITH GH CLASSROOM
<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 1.1` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 1.1` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions & Requirements

#### Iteration 1: Create Initial Structure
<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Within the project, navigate to the `index.html` file.
1. Ensure that it is already filled out with the usual **boilerplate HTML**, with a `head` and `body` section inside the opening & closing `html` tags.
2. Add an `h1` heading in the body section that describes the main title of the website (like _"My Favorite Recipes"_ or _"Sweet Treats for Fall"_).

</div> 

#### Iteration 2: Start Recipe Section

<div class="task" markdown="block">
 
1. Create a **new `div` element** to group together the information for your first recipe on the page.
  
2. Specify a **unique identifier** within the `div` opening tag, like this: `<div id="recipe-name">`
> You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).

3. For now, just include an `h2` **heading** inside the `div`, with the recipe's name as its content.

4. Back at the top of the `body` section, under the first `h1`, add a **link** to the recipe `div` section you just created.
> _Example:_ `<a href="#recipe-name">Recipe Name</a>`. 
> * The `href` attribute is directing the anchor to the `div` on the page that has `id="recipe-name"`. Replace `recipe-name` with your own identifier.
> * The _text_ of the link should again be replaced with the actual recipe name.

</div>

#### Iteration 3: Add Recipe Section Content

<div class="task" markdown="block">
 
Your new recipe `div` section must include the following content:
1. An **image** of the finished dish under the `h2` heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
1. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized (_smaller than the recipe title heading_) "Description" **heading** followed by a **paragraph** or two describing the recipe.
1. Under the description, add an "Ingredients" **heading** followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
1. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" **heading** followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

</div>

#### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Add **two more recipes** with identical structures to the recipe `div` section you've already created.
1. Don't forget to **link** to the new recipes at the top of the page. This will help with **navigation** around your page, so users can click to jump to the recipe they want to see.

Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.

_Example:_

```html
 <ul>
    <li><a href="#lasagna">Lasgana Recipe</a></li>
    <li><a href="#pizza">Pizza Recipe</a></li>
    <li><a href="#chicken-milanese">Chicken Milanese Recipe</a></li>
  </ul>
```
  
Your links won't be flashy, but for now, just focus on building them out.

</div>

### Extensions
* Add even more recipes!
* Incorporate emojis to embellish your text content, if you like the way they look. 
* Create a **header image** or **logo** for your recipe blog on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and add it to the top of your page before the `h1` heading.
