### Overview & Setup

It's time to practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time you've finished, unless you're into [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/), that is.

But it's important to keep in mind that this project is just to build your HTML chops; we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

<div class="setup" markdown="block">
 
1. On [Replit](https://replit.com/~), click `+ Create Repl` on the sidebar to open a **NEW PROJECT**
2. In the pop-up menu, select `HTML, CSS, JS` as the **TEMPLATE**
3. Specify the **TITLE** following this pattern: `CS1_Unit1_Proj1_FirstNameLastInitial`

</div>

### Instructions & Requirements

<div class="task" markdown="block">
#### Iteration 1: Create Initial Structure

1. Within the Replit project, navigate to the `index.html` file.
1. Ensure that it is already filled out with the usual **boilerplate HTML**.
2. Add an `h1` heading in the body section that describes the main title of the website (like _"My Favorite Recipes"_ or _"Sweet Treats for Fall"_).

</div> 

<div class="task" markdown="block">
#### Iteration 2: Start Recipe Page
 
1. Create a new directory (folder) within the project and name it `recipes`.
1. Create a new HTML file within the  `recipes` directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example `lasagna.html`. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
1. For now, just include an `h1` heading with the recipe's name as its content.
1. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. _Example:_ Under the `<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>` heading, write out the link like so: `<a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>`. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

</div>

<div class="task" markdown="block">
#### Iteration 3: Add Recipe Page Content
 
Your new recipe page must have the following content:
1. An **image** of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or [Allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/).
1. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized "Description" **heading** followed by a **paragraph** or two describing the recipe.
1. Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed by an **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
1. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" heading followed by an **ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

</div>

<div class="task" markdown="block">
#### Iteration 4: Add More Recipes

1. Add **two more recipes** with identical page structures to the recipe page you've already created.
1. Don't forget to **link** to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren't all on one line.

Example:

```html
 <ul>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 1</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/yourrecipe.html">Recipe Title 3</a></li>
  </ul>
```
  
Your links won't be flashy, but for now, just focus on building them out.

</div>
