### Overview & Setup



<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Find your `CS1 Project 1.1` repository with your **Recipe Blog HTML code**.
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, you **do not need to submit anything** this time because I _already have the links to your Recipe Blog repositories_.

### Instructions & Requirements

<div class="task" markdown="1">

üé® Remember the Recipe page you created for `Project #1.1` to practice the HTML topics? Well, it's rather *plain* looking, isn't it? Let's fix that by adding some CSS styling to it!

- How you actually style it is completely open, but you should use the **external CSS method** (for this practice and moving forward).
- You should also try to use several of the properties mentioned in the previous section (**color**, **background color**, **typography** properties, etc).
  - Take some time to play around with the various properties to get a feel for what they do. For now, don't worry at all about making it look *good*. This is just to practice and get used to writing CSS, not to make something to show off on your resume.
- We haven't covered how to use a custom font for the `font-family` property yet, so for now take a look at [CSS Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_font.asp) for a list of generic font families to use, and [CSS Web Safe Fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for a list of fonts that are web safe. Web safe means that these are fonts that are installed on basically every computer or device (but be sure to still include a generic font family as a fallback).
- Apply what you learned about the box model to improve the appearance of your Recipe blog from `Project #1.1`. Get creative with **layouts**, **colors**, and **styles** to make your page uniquely captivating!
