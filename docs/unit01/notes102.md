## Introduction to HTML

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** defines the structure and content of webpages. We use **HTML elements** to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links that make up a typical webpage. 

HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet. HTML is the raw data and content that a webpage is built out of. All the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML. CSS is what adds *style* to those plain elements. HTML puts information on a webpage, and CSS positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

Many great resources out there keep referring to HTML and CSS as *programming languages*, but if you want to get technical, labeling them as such is not quite accurate, because they are only concerned with presenting information. They are not used to program any logic. JavaScript, which you will be learning in the next section, is a programming language because it's used to make webpages do things. Yet, there is quite a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS, and you will definitely need them both. The following lessons focus on giving you the tools you need to be successful once you get to the JavaScript content as you continue through our curriculum!

<div class="task" markdown="1">

1. Read [HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript](https://brytdesigns.com/html-css-javascript-whats-the-difference/) to get a quick overview of the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Discuss with the class. 
2. Save [DevDocs.io](https://devdocs.io) as a bookmark for future reference. It's a massive API documentation collection maintained by [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). Read the 'Welcome' message for more information.

## Elements and Tags

Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

**Opening tags** tell the browser that this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets `<>`. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: `<p>`.

**Closing tags** tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: `</p>`.

A full paragraph element looks like this:

```html
<p>some text content</p>
```

Let's break this down:

- `<p>` is the **opening tag**.
- `some text content` represents **content** wrapped within the opening and closing tags.
- `</p>` is the **closing tag**.

You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains. The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

HTML has a [vast list of predefined tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. It is important to use the correct tags for content. Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites: how they are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML. We will explore this in much more depth later on in the curriculum.

### Void Elements
{:.no_toc}

Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These elements just have a single tag, like: `<br>` or `<img>`. They are known as void elements because they are void of any content, there is nothing inside of them. No closing tag means they can't wrap content like other tags do.

You might also see these referred to as self-closing tags. But those are just void elements with a forward slash(/) at the end like: `<br />` or `<img />`. You're likely to see self-closing tags used often for historical reasons. Browsers will be able to render them just fine, but the latest version of the HTML specification discourages their use and considers them invalid.

---
## HTML Boilerplate

All HTML documents have the same **basic structure** or **boilerplate** that needs to be in place before anything useful can be done. In this lesson, we will explore the different parts of this boilerplate and see how it all fits together.

To demonstrate an HTML boilerplate, we first need an HTML file to work with.

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. On [Replit](https://replit.com/~), click `+ Create Repl` on the sidebar to open a **NEW PROJECT**
2. In the pop-up menu, select `HTML, CSS, JS` as the **TEMPLATE**
3. Specify the **TITLE** following this pattern: `CS1_Unit1_Notes`

</div>

Within the project you'll find a file named `index.html`.

You're probably already familiar with a lot of different types of files, for example doc, pdf, and image files. To let the computer know we want to create an HTML file, we need to append the filename with the `.html` extension, as we have done when creating the `index.html` file.

It is worth noting that we named our HTML file `index`. We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our website `index.html`. This is because web servers will by default look for an `index.html` page when users land on our websites -- and not having one will cause big problems.

### The DOCTYPE Declaration
{:.no_toc}

Every HTML page starts with a **doctype declaration**. The doctype's purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

### HTML Element
{:.no_toc}

After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an `<html>` element. This is what's known as the **root element** of the document, meaning that every other element in the document will be a descendant of it.

This becomes more important later on when we learn about manipulating HTML with JavaScript. For now, just know that the `<html>` element should be included on every HTML document.

Back in the `index.html` file, let's add the `<html>` element by typing out its opening and closing tags, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

Noticed the word `lang` here? It represents an HTML attribute which is associated with the given HTML tag i.e. `<html>` in this case. These attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. (More about `HTML Attributes` in the following lesson.)

### Head Element
{:.no_toc}

The `<head>` element is where we put important meta-information **about** our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
Inside the `<head>`, we **should not** use any element that displays content on the webpage.

Back in our `index.html` file, let's add a `<head>` element with a `<meta>` element and a title within it. The `<head>` element goes within the `<html>` element and should always be the first element under the opening `<html>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

#### Meta Element
{:.no_toc}

We should always have the `<meta>` tag with the **charset encoding** of the webpage in the `<head>` element: `<meta charset="utf-8">`.

Setting the encoding is very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly in the browser.

#### Title Element
{:.no_toc}

Another element we should always include in the head of an HTML document is the `<title>` element:

 `<title>My First Webpage</title>`

The `<title>` element is used to give webpages a human-readable title, which is displayed in our webpage's browser tab. For example, if you look at the current tab's name of your browser, it will read "HTML Boilerplate &#124; The Odin Project"; this is the `<title>` of the current `.html` file.

If we didn't include a `<title>` element, the webpage's title would default to its file name. In our case that would be `index.html`, which isn't very meaningful for users; this would make it very difficult to find our webpage if the user has many browser tabs open.

There are many more elements that can go within the head of an HTML document. However, for now it's only crucial to know about the two elements we have covered here. We will introduce more elements that go into the head throughout the rest of the curriculum.

### Body Element
{:.no_toc}

The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the `<body>` element. This is where **all the content** that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, lists, links, and so on.

To complete the boilerplate, add a `<body>` element to the `index.html` file. The `<body>` element also goes within the `<html>` element and is always below the `<head>` element, like so:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

<div class="task" markdown="1">

Build some muscle memory by deleting the contents of the `index.html` file and trying to write out all the boilerplate again from memory. Don't worry if you have to peek at the lesson content the first few times if you get stuck. Just keep going until you can do it a couple of times from memory.

</div>

## Working with Text

Most content on the web is text-based, so you will find yourself needing to work with HTML text elements quite a bit.

In this module, we will learn about the text-based elements, including:

- How to create paragraphs.
- How to create headings.
- How to create bold text.
- How to create italicized text.
- The relationships between nested elements.
- How to create HTML comments.

### Paragraph Element

What would you expect the following text to output on an HTML page?

```html
<body>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor
  incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

  Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris
  nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
</body>
```

It looks like two paragraphs of text, so you might expect it to display in that way. However, that is not the case, as you can see in the output below:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="xxrKqeV" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/xxrKqeV">
  no-paragraphs-example</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

When the browser encounters new lines like this in your HTML, it will compress them down into one single space. The result of this compression is that all of the text is clumped together into one long line.

If we want to create paragraphs in HTML, <span id='create-paragraph-element'>we need to use the paragraph element</span>, which will add a new line after each of our paragraphs. A paragraph element is defined by wrapping text content with a `<p>` tag.

Changing our example from before to use paragraph elements fixes the issue:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="mdwbmdp" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/mdwbmdp">
  pargraph-example</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

### Heading Elements

Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are displayed larger and bolder than other text to signify that they are headings.

<span id='different-heading-levels'>There are 6 different levels of headings starting from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The number within a heading tag represents that heading's level. The largest and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading at the lowest level.</span>

Headings are defined much like paragraphs. For example, to create an h1 heading, we wrap our heading text in an `<h1>` tag:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="LYLPLbg" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/LYLPLbg">
  HTML-headings-example</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide a **hierarchy** to the content. An h1 heading should always be used for the heading of the overall page, and the lower level headings should be used as the headings for content in smaller sections of the page.

### Strong (Bold) Element

The `<strong>` element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important; this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website. The tone of voice on some screen readers will change to communicate the importance of the text within a strong element. To define a strong element, we wrap text content in a `<strong>` tag.

You can use strong on its own, but you will probably find yourself using the strong element much more in combination with other text elements, like this:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="wvewqJr" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/wvewqJr">
  HTML-strong-with-paragraph-exmample</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Sometimes you will want to make text bold without giving it an important meaning. You'll learn how to do that in the CSS lessons later in the curriculum.

### Emphasised (Italic) Element

The `<em>` element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers. To define an emphasised element, wrap the text content in an `<em>` tag.

Again, like the strong element, you will find yourself mostly using the `<em>` element with other text elements:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="VwWZzyj" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/VwWZzyj">
  HTML-em-with-paragraph-example</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

### Nesting and Indentation
{:.no_toc}

You may have noticed that in all the examples in this lesson we indent any elements that are within other elements. This is known as **nesting elements**.

When we nest elements within other elements, we create a **parent** and **child** relationship between them. The nested elements are the children and the element they are nested within is the parent.</span>

> In the following example, which element is the parent and which element is the child?

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="oNwjEvO" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/oNwjEvO">
  HTML-nesting-parent-child</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Just as in human relationships, HTML parent elements can have many children.  <span id='elements-same-level'>Elements at the same level of nesting are considered to be **siblings**.</span>

We use indentation to make the level of nesting clear and readable for ourselves and other developers who will work with our HTML in the future. In our examples, we have indented any child elements by two spaces per nesting level.

The parent, child, and sibling relationships between elements will become much more important later when we start styling our HTML with CSS and adding behavior with JavaScript. For now, however, it is just important to know the distinction between how elements are related and the terminology used to describe their relationships.

### HTML Comments
{:.no_toc}

HTML **comments are not visible to the browser**; they allow us to *comment* on our code so that other developers or our future selves can read them and get some context about something that might not be clear in the code.

In order to write an HTML comment, we just enclose the comment with `<!--` and `-->` tags. For example:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="abwoyBg" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/abwoyBg">
  HTML-comments-example</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<br> 

<div class="task" markdown="1">

To get some practice working with text in HTML, create a plain blog article page which uses different **headings**, uses **paragraphs**, and has some text in the paragraphs **bolded** and **italicized**.

## Lists

Whether it be IMDB's top 250 movies or the FBI's most wanted, lists are everywhere on the web and you are going to need one eventually in your webpages.

Luckily, with HTML there are a couple of different types of lists at your disposal: **unordered** or **ordered**.

### Unordered Lists

If you want to have a list of items where the order doesn't matter, like a shopping list of items that can be bought in any order, then you can use an unordered list.

Unordered lists are created using the `<ul>` element, and <span id="li"></span>each item within the list is created using the list item element `<li>`.

Each list item in an unordered list begins with a **bullet point**:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="powjajd" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/powjajd">
  html-unordred-list</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

### Ordered Lists

If you instead want to create a list of items where the order *does* matter, like step-by-step instructions for a recipe, or your top 10 favorite TV shows, then you can use an ordered list.

Ordered lists are created using the `<ol>` element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element `<li>`. However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a **number** instead:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="yLXYvYp" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/yLXYvYp">
  html-ordered-list</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

<br> 

<div class="task" markdown="1">

To get some practice using lists, create the following lists in your HTML document:

1. An unordered shopping list of your favorite foods
1. An ordered list of todo's you need to get done today
1. An unordered list of places you'd like to visit someday
1. An ordered list of your all time top 5 favorite video games or movies

## Links and Images

Links are one of the key features of HTML. They allow us to link to other HTML pages on the web. In fact, this is why it was named the "web" üï∏Ô∏è. 

In this lesson, we will learn:

- How to create links to pages on other websites on the internet.
- How to create links to other pages on your own websites.
- The difference between absolute and relative links.
- How to display an image on a webpage using HTML.

### Anchor (Link) Element

‚öìÔ∏è To create a link in HTML, we use the **anchor** element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an `<a>` tag.

Add the following to the body of the `index.html` page:

```html
<a>About The Odin Project</a>
```

You may have noticed that clicking this link doesn't do anything. This is because an anchor tag on its own won't know where we want to link to. We have to tell it a destination to go to. We do this by using an HTML attribute.

<span id="attribute"></span>An HTML **attribute** gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element's opening tag. An attribute is usually made up of two parts: a **name**, and a **value**; however, not all attributes require a value. <span id="where-to-go"></span>In our case, we need to add an href (hypertext reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag. The value of the href attribute is the destination we want our link to go to.

Add the following `href` attribute to the anchor element we created previously and try clicking it again, don't forget to refresh the browser so the new changes can be applied.

```html
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a>
```

By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without an `href` attribute will look like plain text. If the `href` attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.

It's worth noting you can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents.

### Absolute vs. Relative Links
{:.no_toc}

Generally, there are two kinds of links we will create:

- **Absolute Links:** Links to pages on other websites on the internet.
  - A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: `protocol://domain/path`. An absolute link will always contain the protocol and domain of the destination, for example: `https://www.theodinproject.com/about`
- **Relative Links:** Links to pages located on our own websites.
  - Relative links do not include the domain name, since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.

### Image Elements

Websites would be fairly boring if they could only display text. Luckily HTML provides a wide variety of elements for displaying all sorts of different media. The most widely used of these is the **image** element.

To display an image in HTML we use the `<img>` element. Unlike the other elements we have encountered, the `<img>` element is a void element. _As we have seen earlier in the course, void elements do not need a closing tag because they are naturally empty and do not contain any content._

Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a `src` **attribute** which tells the browser where the image file is located. The `src` attribute works much like the `href` attribute for anchor tags. It can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths.

For example, using an **absolute path** we can display an image located on The Odin Project site:

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="gORbExZ" data-user="TheOdinProjectExamples" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples/pen/gORbExZ">
  absolute-path-image</a> by TheOdinProject (<a href="https://codepen.io/TheOdinProjectExamples">@TheOdinProjectExamples</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>

</p>

<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

To display images on your website that are hosted on your own web server, you can use a **relative path**.


<div class="task" markdown="1">
  
1. Create a new directory (folder) named `images` within your project.

1. Next, [download the stock dog image](https://unsplash.com/photos/Mv9hjnEUHR4/download?force=true&w=640).

1. Right click on the new download at the bottom of the Google Chrome window and select "Show in folder".

1. Click `+` in the `Files` pane of your Replit project to upload the image, or try just dragging it in.

1. Finally add the image address to the `index.html` file:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Homepage</h1>
  <img src="./images/dog.jpg">
</body>
```

</div>

### Alt Attribute
{:.no_toc}

<span id="two-attributes"></span>Besides the `src` attribute, every image element must also have an `alt` (alternative text) attribute.

The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

<div class="task" markdown="1">
  
As a bit of practice, add an `alt` attribute to the dog image in the project.
</div>

### Image Size Attributes

While not strictly required, specifying `height` and `width` **attributes** in image tags helps the browser layout the page without causing the page to jump and flash.

It is a good habit to always specify these attributes on every image, even when the image is the correct size or you are using CSS to modify it.

<div class="task" markdown="1">
  
Go ahead and update your project with `width` and `height` tags on the dog image.
</div>
