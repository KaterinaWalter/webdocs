### Overview & Setup

CSS **animations** and **transforms** are powerful tools that bring life to web pages. With **animations**, we can create smooth transitions, moving objects, or even complex _sequences_ of changes, making websites more interactive and visually appealing. **Transforms** allow us to _manipulate elements_ by rotating, scaling, or repositioning them, enabling unique and dynamic designs.

In this project, you'll practice these techniques by building an **animated scene** inside a defined container. You‚Äôll experiment with movement, resizing, and interactivity to make a creative and engaging display. 

> üß† **BRAINSTORM:** Pick your favorite movie, TV show, or book! Look up on Google Images: _"iconic scenes from..."_ + the title. 

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions

#### Part A: Setting Up the Starter Code

<div class="task" markdown="block">
  
1. Add Starter CSS Code
    * Write the following style rules in `style.css`:
```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
2. Set the Background
    * Add a `body` style to include a background image:
```css
body {
    background-image: url("https://wallpaper.dog/large/20552168.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
}
```
3. Add the Scene Description Section
    * Inside the `<body>` tag in `index.html`, create a container to describe the scene:
```html
<div id="scene-description">
    <h1>Scene Title</h1>
    <p>Scene Description</p>
</div>
```
4. Style the Scene Description
    * In `style.css`:
```css
#scene-description {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Sans-Serif;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    color: white;
}
```
5. Add the Scene Container Section
    * Below the `#scene-description`, add the main animation space:
```html
<div id="scene-container"></div>
```
6. Style the Scene Container
    * In `style.css`:
```css
#scene-container {
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;
    margin: auto;
    border: 5px solid black;
    background-color: white;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

</div>

#### Part B: Adding Animations and Transforms

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Plan your Scene
    * Pick an **iconic scene** from a movie, TV show, or book that you'd like to model.
    * Identify several possible animations to make your scene dynamic (e.g., a bouncing ball, flying objects, spinning elements, people walking, etc.).
2.

### Minimum Requirement Checklist

- _HTML Content:_
  - [ ] Include at least **6 HTML elements** inside the `#scene-container` with distinct classes or ids, using the appropriate tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<img>`).
- _CSS Base Styles:_
  - [ ] Style all elements to fit your **theme** (e.g., colors, sizes, positioning).
- _CSS Animations:_
  - [ ] Define at least 2 distinct `@keyframes` **animation sequences**. One of these must have _more than 2 points_ in the animation sequence (e.g. `0%`, `50%`, `100%` rather than just `from` and `to`).
  - [ ] In a selector for the **element** to be animated, specify the relevant **animation** **properties** (e.g., `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`).
- _CSS Transforms:_
  - [ ] Apply at least 4 different `transform` functions (e.g., `rotate`, `scale`, `translate`).
- _CSS Positioning:_
  - [ ] Use at least 2 different **positioning techniques** (e.g., `absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed`).
- _CSS Customization:_
  - [ ] Adjust the `background` of the movie scene, or `border` styles for visual appeal.
  - [ ] Ensure that the final product of your movie scene looks **cohesive**.

#### Bonus Features
- Include an **interactive** effect (e.g., `:hover` pseudo-class selector with a `transition` property).
  - See [W3Schools - Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) and [W3Schools - Pseudoclasses](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp)
- Use CSS **variables** for repeated values.
  - See [W3Schools - Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) 
- Create a "start" `button` that triggers animations using a class toggle (requires some `JavaScript`).
- Experiment with CSS `clip-path` or `filter` for advanced effects.
