### Overview & Setup


> üß† **BRAINSTORM:** Pick your favorite movie! 

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions

### Minimum Requirement Checklist

#### HTML
- _HTML Content:_
  - [ ] Include at least **6 HTML elements** inside the `#scene-container` `div` with distinct classes/ids, using the appropriate tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<img>`).
- _CSS Base Styles:_
  - [ ] Style all elements to fit your **theme** (e.g., colors, sizes, positioning).
- _CSS Animations:_
  - [ ] Define at least 2 distinct `@keyframes` **animation sequences**. One of these must have _more than 2 points_ in the animation sequence (e.g. `0%`, `50%`, `100%` rather than just `from` and `to`).
  - [ ] In a selector for the **element** to be animated, specify the relevant **animation** **properties** (e.g., `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`).
- _CSS Transforms:_
  - [ ] Apply at least 4 different `transform` functions (e.g., `rotate`, `scale`, `translate`).
- _CSS Positioning:_
  - [ ] Use at least 2 different **positioning techniques** (e.g., `absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed`).
- _CSS Customization:_
  - [ ] Adjust the `background` of the movie scene, or `border` styles for visual appeal.
  - [ ] Ensure that the final product of your movie scene looks **cohesive**.

#### Bonus Features
- Include an **interactive** effect (e.g., `:hover` selector with a `transition` property).
- Use CSS **variables** for repeated values.
- Create a "start" `button` that triggers animations using a class toggle (simple `JavaScript`).
- Experiment with CSS `clip-path` or `filter` for advanced effects.
