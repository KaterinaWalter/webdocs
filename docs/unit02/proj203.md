### Overview & Setup

CSS **animations** and **transforms** are powerful tools that bring life to web pages. With **animations**, we can create smooth transitions, moving objects, or even complex _sequences_ of changes, making websites more interactive and visually appealing. **Transforms** allow us to _manipulate elements_ by rotating, scaling, or repositioning them, enabling unique and dynamic designs.

In this project, you'll practice these techniques by building an **animated scene** inside a defined container. You‚Äôll experiment with movement, resizing, and interactivity to make a creative and engaging display. 

> üß† **BRAINSTORM:** Look up on Google Images: _"iconic scenes from..."_ + the title of your favorite **movie**, **show**, or **book**. 

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 2.3` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions

#### Part A: Setting Up the Starter Code

<div class="task" markdown="block">
  
1. **Add Starter CSS Code**
    * Write the following style rules in `style.css`:
```css
html, body {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
2. **Set the Background**
    * Add a `body` style rule to include a background image:
```css
body {
    background-image: url("https://wallpaper.dog/large/20552168.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
}
```
3. **Add the Scene Description Section**
    * Inside the `<body>` tag in `index.html`, create a container to describe the scene: `<div id="scene-description"></div>`
    * Inside that `<div>`, include an `<h1>` element with the scene **title** and a `<p>` element with a brief **description** of the scene. 
4. **Style the Scene Description**
    * In `style.css`:
```css
#scene-description {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-family: "Trebuchet MS", Sans-Serif;
    font-size: 0.8em;
    color: white;
}
```
5. **Add the Scene Container Section**
    * Below the `#scene-description` div in HTML, add another container for the main animation space: `<div id="scene-container"></div>`
6. **Style the Scene Container**
    * In `style.css`:
```css
#scene-container {
    width: 600px;
    height: 400px;
    margin: auto;
    border: 5px solid black;
    background-color: white;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```

</div>

#### Part B: Adding Animations and Transforms

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. **Plan your Scene**
    * Pick an **iconic scene** from a movie, TV show, or book that you'd like to model.
    * Identify several possible animations to make your scene dynamic (_e.g., a bouncing ball, flying objects, spinning elements, people walking, etc._)
2. **Add Elements to the Scene**
    * Inside the `#scene-container`, add HTML elements to represent props, actors, etc.
    * _For example:_
        * `<div id="ground"></div>` for **blocks/shapes**
        * `<span id="ball">üèà</span>` for **emojis/symbols**
        * `<img id="actor" src=" ">` for **images/clipart**
3. **Style the Elements**
    * Define styles for the new elements to position and size them.
    * Example styling for a `span`: 
```css
#ball {
    font-size: 30px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 20%;
    left: 15%;
    z-index: 5;
}
```
4. **Define CSS Animations**
    * Use the `@keyframes` rule to define the **sequence** of an animation.
    * Incorporate `transform` functions like `rotate`, `scale`, and `translate` within your animation sequence.
    * üìñ See [W3Schools - Transforms](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_2dtransforms.asp)
    * _Example:_
```css
@keyframes spin {
    from {
        transform: rotate(0deg);
    }
    to {
        transform: rotate(360deg);
    }
}
```
5. **Attach Animations to Elements**
```css
#ball {
    animation-name: spin;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}
```
6. **Test and Adjust**
    * Ensure the animations are smooth and work well together, adjusting **durations**, **delays**, and **timing functions** as needed.
    * üìñ See [W3Schools - Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)

### Minimum Requirement Checklist

- _HTML Content:_
  - [ ] Include at least **6 HTML elements** inside the `#scene-container` with distinct classes or ids, using the appropriate tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<img>`).
- _CSS Base Styles:_
  - [ ] Style all elements to fit your **theme** (e.g., colors, sizes, positioning).
- _CSS Animations:_
  - [ ] Define at least 2 distinct `@keyframes` **animation sequences**. One of these must have _more than 2 points_ in the animation sequence (e.g. `0%`, `50%`, `100%` rather than just `from` and `to`).
  - [ ] In a selector for the **element** to be animated, specify the relevant **animation** **properties** (e.g., `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`).
- _CSS Transforms:_
  - [ ] Apply at least 4 different `transform` functions (e.g., `rotate`, `scale`, `translate`).
- _CSS Positioning:_
  - [ ] Use at least 2 different **positioning techniques** (e.g., `absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed`).
- _CSS Customization:_
  - [ ] Adjust the `background` of the movie scene, or `border` styles for visual appeal.
  - [ ] Ensure that the final product of your movie scene looks **cohesive**.

#### Bonus Features
- Include an **interactive** effect (e.g., `:hover` pseudo-class selector with a `transition` property).
  - See [W3Schools - Transitions](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) and [W3Schools - Pseudoclasses](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp)
- Use CSS **variables** for repeated values.
  - See [W3Schools - Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) 
- Create a "start" `button` that triggers animations using a class toggle (requires some `JavaScript`).
- Experiment with CSS `clip-path` or `filter` for advanced effects.
