### Overview & Setup

In this creative project, you will use **CSS positioning** to place elements creatively on a webpage. Your goal is to design a unique **townscape** with icons, backgrounds, and `div` boxes styled into different shapes.

> 🧠 **BRAINSTORM:** Pick a fun theme! (city, rural, suburbs, island, fantasy, etc). 

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 2.2` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > 📁 Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ⚠️ Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 2.2` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Minimum Requirements

**Buildings or Structures:**
- [ ] Include at **least 3 buildings or structures** (e.g., houses, stores, towers) created using `<div>` elements.
	* Each building should have a distinct style, size, or color to add variety to your townscape.

**Icons or Emojis:**
- [ ] Use at least 5 icons or emojis to represent elements of your town.
	* Icons or emojis can be added in the sky (e.g., ☁️ or 🌙), as landmarks (e.g., 🏛️ or 🏫), or as decorations (e.g., 🏠 or 🚗).
	* Ensure that these icons are positioned and sized appropriately to fit into the overall design.

**Sky Design:**
- [ ] The sky must include a **gradient background**.
	* You can customize the colors to create a sunrise, sunset, daytime, or nighttime feel.
- [ ] Include at least one emoji or icon in the sky (e.g., ☀️, 🌙, or ☁️).

**Creative Positioning:**
- [ ] Use **CSS positioning** (like `absolute` or `relative`) to place elements creatively around the town. Experiment with different `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom` values to arrange your buildings and icons in a way that resembles a town layout.

**Extra Decorative Element(s):**	
- [ ] Add at least one extra decorative element to each building or structure, such as a roof, door, window, or tree.
	* Each extra element should be styled differently from the main building, using unique colors, shapes, or positioning.
