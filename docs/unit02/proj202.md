### Overview & Setup

In this creative project, you will use **CSS positioning** to place elements creatively on a webpage. Your goal is to design a unique **townscape** with icons, backgrounds, and `div` boxes styled into different shapes.

> 🧠 **BRAINSTORM:** Pick a fun theme! (city, rural, suburbs, island, fantasy, etc). 

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 2.2` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > 📁 Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ⚠️ Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 2.2` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions

{:.highlight}
📖 **RESOURCES:** While working on this project, you are encouraged to look up CSS `properties` on Google or [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), review our [Unit 1 Notes](https://coderina.dev/webdocs/unit01) or [Unit 2 Notes](https://coderina.dev/webdocs/unit02), and make use of the helpful [SheCodes CSS Tools](https://generators.shecodes.io/). 

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. **Add a Background Image:**
	* Find an **image** to use for the ground, such as grass, bricks, or a texture (check out this [Seamless Textures](https://architextures.org/textures) website). Feel free to experiment with different images to find one that fit your vision for the town.
	* In your CSS file, set a `background-image` to represent the ground.
	```css
	body {
		background: url(" ");
		background-size: 20%;
	  	margin: 0;
	  	padding: 0;
	  	box-sizing: border-box;
	  	height: 100%;
		width: 100%;
	}
	```
2. **Create a Gradient Background:**
3. **Add a Symbol/Emoji:**
4. **Build a House with Styled Divs:**
5. 🎨 **Customize your Town:**
	* Get creative! Add more buildings, symbols, or decorative elements to make the town your own.
	* Experiment with shapes, colors, and different icons to add personality to your town.
 	* See below for a **checklist of minimum requirements** for this project. 
</div>

### Minimum Requirements

#### Buildings or Structures:
- [ ] Include at **least 3 buildings or structures** (e.g., houses, stores, towers) created using `<div>` elements.
	* Each building should have a distinct style, size, or color to add variety to your townscape.

#### Symbols or Emojis:
- [ ] Use at least 5 [symbols](https://copychar.cc/symbols/) or [emojis](https://copychar.cc/emoji/) to represent elements of your town.
	* Icons or emojis can be added in the sky (e.g., ☁️ or 🌙), as landmarks (e.g., 🏛️ or 🏫), or as decorations (e.g., 🏠 or 🚗).
	* Ensure that these icons are positioned and sized appropriately to fit into the overall design.

#### Sky Design:
- [ ] The sky must include a [gradient background](https://gradients.shecodes.io/).
	* You can customize the colors to create a sunrise, sunset, daytime, or nighttime feel.
- [ ] Include at least one emoji or icon in the sky (e.g., ☀️, 🌙, or ☁️).

#### Creative Positioning:
- [ ] Use **CSS positioning** (like `absolute` or `relative`) to place elements creatively around the town.
	* Experiment with different `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom` values to arrange your buildings and icons in a way that resembles a town layout.

#### Extra Decorative Element(s):	
- [ ] Add at least one extra decorative element to each building or structure, such as a roof, door, window, or tree.
	* Each extra element should be styled differently from the main building, using unique colors, shapes, or positioning.
