# CodeCollab Homework Instructions

### How to Start
1. Find the discussion assignment on BlackBaud.
2. Follow the provided link to the Replit program.
3. Select `FORK` to make your own copy of the program to run, test, and modify the code.
> Your copy will be saved in the `MY REPLS` section of Replit.
> You can always access my original copy at the link above and fork a new copy if you need to start over.
  
### Discussion Requirements

{: .highlight }
To earn full credit, you must contribute at least **two (2) valid comments** in the discussion before Friday night.

#### Checklist
[] At least one (1) of your comments must be a **standalone post** where you focus on analyzing small sections of code.

> DO NOT attempt to explain the entire program by yourself.

[] Use line numbers and be specific with vocabulary when referring to parts of the program.
[] At least one (1) of your comments must be a direct response to another classmate (save this for later in the week).

See the below section for more detailed guidelines for what qualifies as a "valid" or "acceptable" comment.

### Guidelines & Tips

* üõ†Ô∏è Start by tinkering with and manipulating the existing code on your forked copy of the Replit program. 
  * Make small changes one at a time, press RUN, then observe the resulting output. Focus on understanding the cause and effect of different parts of that code and what it means in terms of the higher level objectives (programming &computational thinking concepts) and lower level objectives (syntax & vocabulary).
  * *EX: Explaining the overall goal / task achieved of a code section would count as a "higher level objective"*
  * *EX: Observing the use of symbols such as curly braces {} would count as a "lower level objective"*
* üìö You are encouraged to refer to the Runestone textbook and to do further research online. Feel free to share links to relevant and helpful articles, images, and videos!
  * Sharing links is a particularly great way to supplement your "response" comment, especially if your classmate asked a question or brought up something that needs further clarification.
* üîç CodeCollabs are **exploratory** endeavors - think of the process like a science experiment. Work submitted will NOT be checked on "correctness" of responses. Rather, the articulation of your thought process. Thus, it's less important that you get the "right answer" and more important that you record your thinking process.
  * _What did you notice? What did you realize? What questions did it generate? What parallels did you see? What research did you do?_
