### Comparison Operators

### "Truthiness"

When we use `if()` statements, we are not always going to be able to plug in a variable with a value of true or false. Many times, we must plug in a **statement** that will be _evaluated_ by JavaScript as `true` or `false`.

> This is similar to the legal system! Although it is POSSIBLE that there will be one piece of evidence that makes the ‚Äúguilty‚Äù or ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù sentence obvious, it is also likely that a judge or jury will need to evaluate the evidence and make a decision.

For this analogy, let's assume a `true` statement is one that will lead to the conviction of the accused car theft, while a `false` statement will let him/her walk free. Let‚Äôs create a variable called `evidence` and set it to `true`: 

```js
let evidence = true;
 
if (evidence) {
  convict();
}
 
else {
  release();
}
```
> `convict()` and `release()` are made-up functions. In this case, since evidence is set to true, the judge would convict the car thief. 

Here‚Äôs an interactive diagram of this scenario:
