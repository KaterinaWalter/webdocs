#### New Unit! Use a GitHub Template for class notes:
{:.no_toc}

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the public template **repository** for our class: [BWL-CS HTML/CSS/JS Template](https://github.com/BWL-CS/html-css-js-template)
2. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Use this template</button> button above the list of files then select `Create a new repository`
3. Specify the **repository name**: `CS1-Unit-4-Notes` or `CS1-JavaScript-Notes`
4. Click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Create repository</button>
    > Now you have **your own personal copy** of this starter code that you can always access under the `Your repositories` section of GitHub! 
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` and wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!
7. üìù Take notes in this Codespace during class, coding along with the instructor.

## Introduction to Programming in JavaScript (JS)

*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive"!

{:.highlight}
üìù The programs coded in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and are run **automatically** as the page loads.

> **NOTE:** In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the **browser**, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine). The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".

### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
{:.no_toc}

üåê _In-browser_ JavaScript can do everything related to **webpage manipulation** as well as **interaction** with the user and the webserver.

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

- ‚≠êÔ∏è Add **new HTML** to the page, **change** the existing content, **modify CSS** styles.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è React to user **actions**, like mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Ask **questions** to the visitor, **display** messages and alerts.
- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage").
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).

### The script tag
{:.no_toc}

JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag: 

```html
<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
```

‚ñ∂Ô∏è The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is **automatically executed** when the browser processes the tag.

{:.highlight}
If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a **separate file**, like the `script.js` file already in your project repository.

Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` **attribute**:

```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```

> Here, `/path/to/script.js` is an **absolute path** to the script from the site root. One can also provide a **relative path** from the current page. For instance, `src="script.js"`, just like `src="./script.js"`, would mean a file `"script.js"` in the current folder.

We can give a **full URL** as well. For instance:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
```

To attach **several scripts**, use multiple tags:

```html
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
‚Ä¶
```

{:.highlight}
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put _directly_ into HTML. More complex ones reside in **separate files**. The benefit of a separate file is that **the browser will download it** and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache). 
> Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only _once_. That reduces traffic and makes pages faster!
