## Introduction to Programming in JavaScript (JS)

*JavaScript* was initially created to "make web pages alive"!

{:.highlight}
📝 The programs coded in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and are run **automatically** as the page loads.

> **NOTE:** In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)). When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of Java would help.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the **browser**, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called [the JavaScript engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine). The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".

### What can in-browser JavaScript do?
{:.no_toc}

🌐 _In-browser_ JavaScript can do everything related to **webpage manipulation** as well as **interaction** with the user and the webserver.

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:

- ⭐️ Add **new HTML** to the page, **change** the existing content, **modify CSS** styles.
- ⭐️ React to user **actions**, like mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- ⭐️ Ask **questions** to the visitor, **display** messages and alerts.
- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage").
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)) and [COMET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_(programming)) technologies).

### The script tag
{:.no_toc}

JavaScript programs can be inserted almost anywhere into an HTML document using the `<script>` tag: 

```html
<body>

  <p>Before the script...</p>

  <script>
    console.log('Hello, world!');
  </script>

  <p>...After the script.</p>

</body>
```

{:.highlight}
The `<script>` tag contains JavaScript code which is **automatically executed** when the browser processes the tag. If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a **separate file**, like the `script.js` file already in your project repository.

Script files are attached to HTML with the `src` **attribute**:

```html
<script src="/path/to/script.js"></script>
```

> Here, `/path/to/script.js` is an **absolute path** to the script from the site root. One can also provide a **relative path** from the current page. For instance, `src="script.js"`, just like `src="./script.js"`, would mean a file `"script.js"` in the current folder.

We can give a **full URL** as well. For instance:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>
```

To attach **several scripts**, use multiple tags:

```html
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>
…
```

{:.highlight}
As a rule, only the simplest scripts are put _directly_ into HTML. More complex ones reside in **separate files**. The benefit of a separate file is that **the browser will download it** and store it in its [cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache). 
> Other pages that reference the same script will take it from the cache instead of downloading it, so the file is actually downloaded only _once_. That reduces traffic and makes pages faster!

### JS Code Structure

The first thing we'll study is the **building blocks** of JavaScript code.

<html>
<dl>
<dt>Syntax</dt>
<dd>The "grammar" rules of a programming language, which include meaningful <strong>symbols</strong>, <strong>keywords</strong>, and <strong>patterns</strong>.</dd>
<dt>Statements</dt>
<dd>Statements are <strong>syntax constructs</strong> and <strong>commands</strong> that perform <em>actions</em>.</dd>
</dl>
</html>

We've already seen a _statement_, `console.log('Hello world!');`, which shows the message "Hello, world!" in the **OUTPUT** frame.

{:.highlight}
We can include as many **statements** (_commands/instructions_) in our code as we want! Statements are separated with a **semicolon** (` ; `), which acts like a _stop sign_ 🛑 after an instruction.

#### Comments
{:.no_toc}

As time goes on, programs become more and more complex. It becomes necessary to add *comments* which describe what the code does and why.

Comments can be put into any place of a script. They don't affect its execution because the engine simply **ignores** them.

{:.important}
**One-line comments start with two forward slash characters `//`.**

The rest of the line is a comment. It may occupy a full line of its own or follow a statement.

Like here:
```js
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

alert('World'); // This comment follows the statement
```

{:.important}
**Multiline comments** start with a forward slash and an asterisk <code>/&#42;</code> and end with an asterisk and a forward slash <code>&#42;/</code>.

Like this:
```js
/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/
alert('Hello');
alert('World');
```

The content of comments is **ignored**, so if we put code inside <code>/&#42; ... &#42;/</code>, it won't execute.

Sometimes it can be handy to _temporarily disable_ a part of code:

```js
/* Commenting out the code
alert('Hello');
*/
alert('World');
```

### Variables & Data Types

Most of the time, a JavaScript application needs to work with **data** (information). Here are two examples:
1. An online shop - the information might include goods being sold and a shopping cart.
2. A chat application - the information might include users, messages, and much more.

**Variables** are used to _store_ information. A [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) is a "named storage" for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

<div class="imp" markdown="block">

##### Key points:
{:.no_toc}

- **DATA** is information 🧠
- **VARIABLES** store data → *like a **box** * 📦
- **DATA TYPES** are categories of data → *like **labels** on the boxes* 🏷️
    
</div>

#### JS DATA TYPES
{:.no_toc}

| `Number` | 🔢 a **quantity/amount** that is either a **whole/integer** number or a **decimal/fractional** number |
| `String` | 🔤 a collection of **individual characters** (letters/numbers/symbols) that are “*strung together*” to form **text/words/sentences** |
| `Boolean` | either `true` or `false` |
| `Array` | a **list** of multiple values, each value has an **index** number that indicates its position/order in the collection  |
| `Object` | *custom* data types that hold a **group** of data, usually to represent a real-world object or an HTML document |

#### Creating Variables

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.

- **VARIABLES** are containers for *carrying values* within your script

![image](truck-declare-var.gif)

- This is called **declaring** a variable. It creates a new truck called *days* that can drive around your script and deliver its **value** OR pick up a new **value**.
- The `let` **KEYWORD (also** `var` but no one uses that anymore**)** allows us to create **mutable** variables whose values can be changed.
    - `let` announces that you are creating a new variable. Or, in the analogy we are about to use, buying a new truck.
    - If we used the `const` keyword, it would mean that the value is **immutable** and unchangeable.
- The variable needs a unique **name**, which is *days* here. This distinguishes this truck from all the other trucks.
- The **assignment operator**, or `=` sign, is NOT an “equals sign” like in math equations → it’s more like **a ramp that loads up a truck**
    - In this example, it loads the **value** 7, into the *days* truck
- The variable `days` is not “equal” to anything! It merely carries around the value that you assign to it.
- In JS, unlike math, you can simply **RE-ASSIGN** a new value to the variable later: `days = 5;` → the assignment operator loads a new value on to the *days* truck
- You can **PASS** a variable into **FUNCTIONS** like this:
    
![image](truck-use-var.gif)

   
The statement below creates (in other words: *declares*) a variable with the name "message":

```js
let message;
```

Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=`:

```js
let message;

*!*
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
*/!*
```

The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:

```js
let message;
message = 'Hello!';

*!*
alert(message); // shows the variable content
*/!*
```

To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

```js
let message = 'Hello!'; // define the variable and assign the value

alert(message); // Hello!
```

#### `var` instead of `let`
{:.no_toc}

In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: `var` instead of `let`:

```js
var message = 'Hello';
```

The `var` keyword is *almost* the same as `let`. It also declares a variable but in a slightly different, "old-school" way.

There are subtle differences between `let` and `var`, but they do not matter to us yet. 


#### A real-life analogy
{:.no_toc}

We can easily grasp the concept of a "variable" if we imagine it as a "box" for data, with a uniquely-named sticker on it.

For instance, the variable `message` can be imagined as a box labelled `"message"` with the value `"Hello!"` in it:

![image](variable.svg)

We can put any value in the box.

We can also change it as many times as we want:

```js run
let message;

message = 'Hello!';

message = 'World!'; // value changed

alert(message);
```

When the value is changed, the old data is removed from the variable:

![image](variable-change.svg)

We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other.

```js
let hello = 'Hello world!';

let message;

// copy 'Hello world' from hello into message
message = hello;

// now two variables hold the same data
alert(hello); // Hello world!
alert(message); // Hello world!
```

<div class="warn" markdown="block">

A variable should be **DECLARED** only once. A repeated declaration of the same variable triggers an error:

```js run
let message = "This";

// repeated 'let' leads to an error
let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared
```
So, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without `let`.

- **FUNCTIONS** are **reusable** sets of **code** **statements** that accomplish a specific task in a certain way
    - `console.log()` is a built-in **function** that **prints** data by *logging* information in the console
    - Inside the **parenthesis** (`()`) goes the data to be printed
    - Indicate `String` data by surrounding it with **quotations** (`””`) → 💬
