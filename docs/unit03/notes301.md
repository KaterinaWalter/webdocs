## Developing Responsive Websites

ü•æ Bootstrap is a popular _front-end framework_ for developing **responsive** and **mobile-first** websites. 

![image](responsive_design.png)

<html>
<dl>
  <dt>Responsive</dt>
  <dd>Websites that <strong>automatically scale</strong> between devices ‚Äî whether the device is a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, screen reader, etc.</dd>
</dl>
</html>

<html>
<dl>
  <dt>Mobile-First</dt>
  <dd>Websites that are primarily designed for mobile devices, then scales up from there (as opposed to being designed first for desktop, then trying to scale it down to mobile devices)</dd>

### What is Bootstrap?
{:.no_toc} 

Bootstrap provides a collection of CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for **layout**, **typography**, **forms**, **buttons**, **navigation**, and other reusable **components**. You are free to use whichever Bootstrap components you choose, while adding your own on top. There are thousands of websites out there that are built on Bootstrap, but with their own design.

Bootstrap can be used to build websites of any scale, from small blogs to large corporate websites. Organizations that use Bootstrap include [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), [FIFA](https://www.fifa.com/en), [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/), [VOGUE](https://www.vogue.com/) and many more.

#### Why Use Bootstrap?
{:.no_toc} 
* **Ease of Use:** Prebuilt styles and components.
* **Responsiveness:** Automatic adjustment to different screen sizes.
* **Consistency:** Uniform design across devices and browsers.
* **Customizability:** Override or extend styles as needed.
* **Fast Development:** Reusable components save time.

### Installing Bootstrap 5 via CDN

The simplest way to load/use Bootstrap is by including its **CDN link** in your HTML file. A **CDN** (**C**ontent **D**elivery **N**etwork) is a distributed network of servers strategically located in different parts of the world to deliver content, such as files, images, and scripts, to users faster and more reliably.

1. Include the CDN link to Bootstrap's CSS code in the `<head>` section:
    ```html
    {% raw %}
        <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
        <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    {% endraw %} 
    ```
1. To use interactive elements like **carousels** (slideshows) and **modals** (pop-up windows), include the CDN link to Bootstrap's JavaScript code at the _END_ of your `<body>` section:
    ```html
    {% raw %}
        <!-- Bootstrap JS (optional) -->
        <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
    {% endraw %} 
    ```

## Bootstrap Tutorial

### Containers

Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that **contain**, **pad**, and **align** your content within a given device or viewport. Bootstrap requires a *containing element* to wrap elements and contain its grid system (more on the grid system next). Bootstrap's container **classes** were created specifically for this purpose.

Bootstrap 5 includes three different container types:
* Fixed
* Fluid
* Responsive (see [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/containers/))

#### Fixed Containers
{:.no_toc}
A fixed container is a (responsive) **fixed width** container. As you resize your browser, its width remains intact, until it passes a certain _breakpoint_ (as specified by you ‚Äî more on that next), at which time it will resize to the new width for that break point.

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```

#### Fluid Containers
{:.no_toc}

A fluid container spans the **full width of the viewport**. It will expand and contract fluidly as you _resize_ the browser. This is in contrast to the fixed width container which will appear to "jump" to the new size as you pass a given break point.


```html
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
```

### Grid System

Grid systems enable you to create advanced layouts using **rows** and **columns**. The Bootstrap grid system can have up to **12 columns**, and you can specify how these columns scale for different viewport sizes.


### Typography

### Images

### Buttons

### Navigation

### Components
