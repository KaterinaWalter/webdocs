## üñºÔ∏è ACTIVITY #1: Art Gallery

We will build a professional-looking webpage for a fictional **art gallery** using ONLY Bootstrap classes for all of the styling and layout. 

### PART A: Design a Hero Section

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Decide on a **theme**! Your gallery can be focused on an _art history period_ (Renaissance, impressionist, postmodern, etc.), an _artistic medium_ (photography, sculpture, etc.), or specific _subject_.  

1. In your HTML's `<body>` section, add two `<div>` elements with Bootstrap container classes. One should be a **fluid container**, the other a **fixed container**.

1. In the **fluid** container div, include an `<h1>` element with a title for your gallery, and a `<p>` element with a description of your gallery. 

1. Download an **image** that represents the "storefront" of your gallery and upload it to your repository's File Explorer tab.

1. In the **fixed** container div, include an `<img>` element with the `src` set to your storefront image. Give the image a class of `class="img-thumbnail"`.

</div>

### PART B: Apply Styles with Typography & Color Classes

Now that your page has some opening content, let‚Äôs enhance the appearance using Bootstrap‚Äôs built-in **typography** and **color utility classes**.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Use **text classes** to change the appearance of your gallery‚Äôs title and description. Try adding emphasis with classes like `fw-bold`, `fst-italic`, or `text-uppercase`.
   üëâ *Optional challenge*: Use `display-*` classes for oversized titles (e.g., `display-1`, `display-2`...).

2. Choose a **color scheme** for your hero section. Use **text color**, **background color**, and **border** utility classes from Bootstrap. Make sure your colors complement each other!
   üëâ Examples: `bg-dark text-light`, `border border-primary`, `bg-warning text-dark`, etc.

3. Try adjusting **spacing** with Bootstrap‚Äôs margin (`m-*`) and padding (`p-*`) utility classes to better position your elements on the page.

4. Optional: Use `text-center`, `text-end`, or `text-start` to align your text.

</div>

### PART C: Set up a Responsive Grid Structure

Let‚Äôs create a layout for your artwork using Bootstrap‚Äôs **grid system**.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Inside a `<div class="container">`, add a `<div class="row">` to begin your grid.

2. Create **at least 3 columns** (`<div class="col">`) inside your row. These will hold the featured artwork for your gallery.

3. Explore **responsive column classes** like `col-sm-6`, `col-md-4`, or `col-lg-3` to make your layout adjust on different screen sizes.
   üëâ Try mixing column sizes to experiment with how Bootstrap adapts your layout!

4. Give each column a **unique border or background color class** so you can easily see the structure.

</div>

### PART D: Populate the Grid with Images

Time to bring your gallery to life by adding some artwork!

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. Inside each column from Part C, add an `<img>` element to showcase a piece of art. You can find royalty-free artwork online (e.g., [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com), or [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org)).

2. Use the Bootstrap class `img-fluid` on your images so they scale correctly on all screen sizes.

3. Add a **caption** below each image using a `<p>` or `<small>` tag. Style these captions using `text-muted`, `fw-light`, or alignment classes (`text-center`, etc.).

4. Optional: Wrap each image and caption in a `<div class="card">` to give it a framed, elevated look. Try combining with `shadow`, `border`, or `rounded` classes for extra polish.

</div>
