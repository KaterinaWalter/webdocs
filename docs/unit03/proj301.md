### Overview & Setup

In this project, you will create a **responsive one-page personal website** that demonstrates your mastery of Bootstrap and the concepts covered in the tutorials. The project is open-ended to encourage creativity while giving you the opportunity to practice building a responsive and visually appealing website.

#### Project Goal
Design and develop a **one-page personal website** using Bootstrap classes and UI components. Your website should reflect your _personality_, _interests_, or _goals_ and include well-organized sections with responsive layouts.

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 3.1` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > üìÅ Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 3.1` assignment on Blackbaud.

### Instructions

#### Plan Your Personal Website

Decide on the _content_ and _structure_ of your website. At a minimum, your site should include the following sections:
- **Hero Section**: A welcoming section with your name, a title, and a short tagline. 
- **About Me**: A section describing who you are, your interests, or your goals.
- **Portfolio/Showcase**: Highlight your work, hobbies, or achievements using cards, images, or a grid layout.

<div class="task" markdown="block">
  
üß† **BRAINSTORMING CONTENT:**
- **Hero Section**: Think about how you want to introduce yourself. Consider a tagline or quote that represents your values or aspirations.
- **About Me**: What makes you unique? Share your hobbies, favorite activities, or personal story. Include a profile picture or avatar.
- **Portfolio/Showcase**: If you have completed projects, hobbies, or any creative work, showcase them here. If not, create placeholders for future content.
- **Skills**: Highlight your technical or personal skills.
- **Testimonials**: Add quotes from your peers or feedback from others.
- **Hobbies**: Showcase things you enjoy doing.

üí° **DESIGN INSPIRATION:** 
- [Developer Portfolio Websites](https://github.com/emmabostian/developer-portfolios)
  - Scroll down to the list of links, open random pages, and make notes of _design choices_ that resonate with you, such as interesting layouts or font styles
- Explore [Coolors - Trending Color Palettes](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) and [SheCodes - Color Palette Ideas](https://www.shecodes.io/palettes)

</div>

#### Create Your Layout
1. **Hero Section**:
   - Use a full-width background image or gradient.
   - Add a large heading and a short tagline centered in the section.
   - You can deviate from the suggestions above, but you should still have an eye-catching section at the top.
1. **Grid-Based Layout**:
   - Use Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive layouts for your content.
   - Experiment with different column sizes for each section (e.g., `.col-6`, `.col-md-4`).
1. **Include UI Components**:
   - Use Bootstrap components like cards, buttons, badges, or carousels to make your site visually appealing.


#### Fill in Content and Images
1. Add meaningful text content for each section.
2. Use images that reflect your personality, work, or interests.
3. Optimize images by resizing them to appropriate dimensions for the web.


#### Customize with CSS
1. Create a `style.css` file to override Bootstrap styles and personalize your website. Apply custom styles to make the website uniquely yours, such as changing fonts/colors, or adding special CSS animations. 
2. _Example:_ Override the `.bg-primary` class to change its color:
   ```css
   .bg-primary {
       background-color: #ff5733 !important; 
   }
   ```

{:.warning}
Overriding Bootstrap's pre-defined class names DOES NOT ALWAYS work! In this case, just add your own `id` or `class` attribute to the HTML element and select for it in CSS.
