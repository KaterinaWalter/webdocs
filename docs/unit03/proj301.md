### Overview & Setup



<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the `CS1 Project 3.1` assignment on **Blackbaud** and follow the provided **GitHub Classroom** link.
  > 📁 Clicking the link generates a **private repository** for your project with the appropriate starter code. Note that **projects** are stored within the [BWL-CS Organization](https://github.com/BWL-CS), so you _cannot_ access it from the "Your Repositories" page!
2. Open the repository in a **Codespace** whenever you spend time working on the program, in class or at home. 
  > ⚠️ Always remember to `commit changes` after every coding session!
3. When your project is complete, **submit the link to your repository** in the `CS1 Project 3.1` assignment on Blackbaud.
