 <summary><strong>COURSE DESCRIPTION</strong></summary>

<div markdown="block">
 
> The _Pre-AP Computer Science_ course introduces students to programming with a special emphasis on **Website Development**. By engaging with current technologies, students enhance their creativity, critical thinking abilities, and problem-solving skills in a context that is highly relevant and applicable. The first semester is dedicated to static website creation, where students learn to build the structure of pages using `HTML`, style them with `CSS`, and enhance functionality by leveraging popular toolkits like `Bootstrap`. Each student designs and codes their own multi-page personal website that is mobile-responsive, user-friendly, and has a cohesive aesthetic. In the second semester, students enhance their HTML pages by integrating `JavaScript` (JS), a powerful programming language that enables dynamic behavior, user interaction, and data processing. Time permitting, industry-standard JS libraries like `React` and `Node.js` are explored. Throughout the year, the class engages in meaningful discussions about the legal, social, and ethical issues surrounding internet-based technology in modern society. Students emerge from the Pre-AP course equipped with an understanding of their potential impact within the field of technology, proficiency in three complementary coding languages, and the ability to code fully-functional, interactive websites.

## Assignments & Grading

> Assignments in this course include: **PROJECTS** (40% of overall grade), **HOMEWORK** (30% of overall grade), and **CLASSWORK** (30% of overall grade). _See below for details, procedures, and grading policies_.

### PROJECTS (40%)
* üíª **Projects** serve as the bulk of our coursework. Expect at least one major coding project assigned per unit, to which we will dedicate several weeks of class time.
  * Projects involve writing full programs that have rigorous requirements designed to test your technical skills, however, plenty of **support** is available during class time and office hours to ensure all targets are met. 
  * As such, the grades you earn on projects will depend heavily on your üé® **creative effort**.
  
* _Projects follow this workflow:_
> 1. A link to a **GitHub template repository** will be provided as starter code. A `repository`, or "repo," is like a üìÇ _project folder_ that contains several code files.
> 2. You will write your code in the **GitHub Codespaces IDE**. An `IDE` is an "Integrated Development Environment," which means an application (or web-app) where you can _write and run code_.
> 3. Your completed project will be submitted on **Blackbaud** by copying your üîó _repository link_. 

* Projects are graded on a 5-point scale, and **EXTRA CREDIT** is always available to encourage effort and creativity. _See the rubric section below for details._

<summary><strong class="text-purple-100">PROJECT GRADING RUBRIC</strong></summary>

<p class="fs-3 highlight">Programming projects are evaluated via a qualitative system considering a program‚Äôs efficiency, legibility, correctness, completeness, documentation, and creativity. The grading rubric employs a 5-point scale. The overall assignment score is then adjusted to be out of 10 points, so that all grades start from a <strong>scaled zero</strong> (baseline grade of 50%). Extra credit may be awarded for exceptional effort!</p>

* üíØ **GRADE IMPROVEMENT POLICY**: You may <span class="highlighter">re-submit projects for a full RE-GRADE</span>, but you must email me to let me know which project, and it must be completed at least one week BEFORE the end of the current quarter.
  * When re-working your projects, you are encouraged to come to **office hours** for help or additional feedback. I am way more likely to grade your work favorably if you have shown effort towards improving your skills...
  * Coding is an **iterative process** which means it is VERY normal not to have your programs working perfectly the first time! Programmers often have to edit their code many times.
  
{: .warning .fs-3 }
üìß You must **SEND ME AN EMAIL** whenever you update or resubmit a project, especially after the assignment has been graded on Blackbaud! _Otherwise I will not be notified._

### HOMEWORK (30%)
* üí¨ **Homework** is assigned in the form of a `CodeCollab`: like posting on a discussion board, but instead of talking about a book or article, the class has a shared goal of figuring out how some üîç mystery code works.

* _Homework assignments follow this workflow:_
> 1. At the beginning of each week, I will **post a DISCUSSION assignment on Blackbaud** that includes a **GitHub repository link** to a working program that you will **analyze collaboratively**.
> 2. You will "fork the repository" (_make your own copy of the program_) to run it, experiment with it, and figure out how it works. The goal is to practice describing and explaining code language in plain English.
> 3. To earn full credit, you must post **at least two (2) comments**: one main post, and one response to a classmate. See our course website's [CodeCollab Instructions](https://coderina.dev/webdocs/docs/ref/codecollab.html) page for detailed guidelines.

{: .highlight .fs-3 }
CodeCollabs are always **due on `Fridays @ 11:59PM`**‚ùó

* ‚è∞ **LATE HW GRADING PENALTIES**: Late homework assignments will receive **no penalty** if submitted _within one week_ of the deadline (_i.e. by the following Friday_), a **5% deduction** in points if submitted in the _2nd week past_ the deadline, and a **10% deduction** if submitted _later than 3 weeks_.

{: .warning .fs-3 }
üìß You must **SEND ME AN EMAIL** whenever you submit homework late, especially after the assignment has been graded on Blackbaud! _Otherwise I will not be notified._

### CLASSWORK (30%)
* üìù **Classwork** involves a mix of note-taking lessons and interactive coding activities.
  * üìì **Notes:** Each unit begins with a series of tutorial-style lessons where you will write code alongside the instructor, learning new concepts through practical demonstrations while building your own working program to use as a reference.
  * üéØ **Activities:** Between note-taking sessions, you will also be tasked with coding exercises that provide you opportunities to check your understanding, play around with new skills, think creatively, practice debugging, solve challenges, and collaborate with peers. _Think of these activities as mini-projects._

{: .highlight .fs-3 }
Expect at least one classwork-type assignment to be **graded** each week: Either a "note check" to confirm you are caught up on new material, or a completion grade for a coding activity. _It should be easy to get 100% in this category if you are engaged and on-task during class time._

{: .warning .fs-3 }
‚ÄºÔ∏è If you are **ABSENT**, you are expected to take initiative to catch up on any missed classwork! _Everything_ we cover in class is on the **course website**. Refer to the **Blackbaud** classwork assignment each week to see which üìì **note sections** were covered or which üéØ **activities** need to be completed.

## Expectations & Policies

### Community Values

> Our classroom culture relies on embracing these 3 key values: **PREPAREDNESS**, **ENGAGEMENT**, and **RESPECT**.

1. Being <span class="highlighter">prepared</span> for class means you have your laptop ready (follow the directions written on the board) within the first 5 minutes of class. It also means you arrive with a positive attitude and ready to learn!
2. Show you are <span class="highlighter">engaged</span> by volunteering answers/comments and completing classwork as directed. You are expected to take your own notes while new material is being introduced, to contribute during group activities, and be open to collaborating with all classmates.
  * Student actions that interfere with learning will NOT be tolerated. Do not squander your time here on distracting apps, side conversations, or doing work for other classes.
3. Being <span class="highlighter">respectful</span> of your community means being mindful of and kind toward your environment and the people within.
  * Respect includes arriving **on-time** as it affects the entire class.
  * Respect others‚Äô property. Avoid touching or writing on anything that does not belong to you.
  * Pick up after yourself and don‚Äôt expect other people (like your teacher) to clean up your messes.
  * Respect each others‚Äô voices by allowing others to finish their comments before jumping in. BWL‚Äôs **Constructive Dialogue Principles** will serve as our framework for successful group discussions:
  > * Let go of winning.
  > * Ask questions to understand.
  > * Find what is shared.
  > * Share your story and invite others to do the same.
  > * Make yourself and others feel heard.

{: .warning .fs-3 }
‚è∞ **TARDINESS:** If you are **over 5 minutes late**, you must first get a LATE PASS from the Upper School Office and enter QUIETLY so as to not disrupt the lesson.

### Other Classroom Policies
* üóìÔ∏è **Office Hours / Extra Help** is held in <span class="highlighter">Room #71</span> during <span class="highlighter">7th period (1:00-1:40) daily</span>.
  * Drop-ins are welcome, meaning there is no need to let me know in advance.  
* üìù You can leave a **sticky note on my desk** for anything you want me to remember to do.
  * _Ex: ‚ÄúPlease re-grade my Unit 1 Project‚Äù_
* üñäÔ∏è **Student supplies** (pens, pencils, sticky notes, etc.) will always be available to borrow, located up front by the whiteboard.
  * No need to ask, but please return pens/pencils after class! 
* ü§û **SILENTLY SIGNAL** that you need to leave for the bathroom or water by holding up crossed fingers.
* üö´ **NO FOOD** in the Computer Lab ‚Üí eat your lunch in the Commons instead.
  * Specifically, please do not bring _meals_ to eat in this classroom. Small **packaged snacks** are OK!
* üì± **NO-PHONE ZONE!** ‚Üí as per the new BWL Upper School policy, phones must be locked up downstairs while you are in the building.
  * If you are caught with a cell phone in class, it will be **confiscated** immediately and you will be sent to the Upper School office.
* üñ•Ô∏è Using your personal **LAPTOP** is a _privilege_.
  * If you are caught using your laptop for things like iMessage, Discord, Snapchat, etc., you will be required to use the **DESKTOP COMPUTERS** in the classroom for a period of time.

{: .important .fs-3 }
üß† Some **mindset** tips: I strongly encourage you all to be **proactive** about your learning, embrace **creativity**, take **responsibility** for your work, and _never be afraid to ask for help_!!! There are no bad questions, and chances are if you are wondering about it, someone else in the class is too. If you feel most comfortable waiting until after class, that is okay, but do keep communication open between us.

### AI Usage Policies 
* **Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI)** tools like ChatGPT are a significant technological advancement that has the potential to support your learning, especially in Computer Science. But with any new technology, there are significant limitations and risks associated with its use, misuse, and overuse. *[Source](https://www.aiforeducation.io/ai-resources/drafting-a-genai-academic-policy)*
* To support appropriate use of GenAI tools in your learning, these **three steps** should always be taken when determining if and when to use GenAI tools:
> 1. **Check with your teacher** if the task or assignment can be completed with the _support_ of a GenAI tool.
> 2. If the tool is allowed, **track your conversation** with the tool by screenshotting or copy-pasting the interaction in a document that you can share with your teacher.
> 3. **Cite the use of the tool** when submitting your work. Here is an example with APA style formatting: `OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT (Mar 14 version) [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com/chat`

{: .warning .fs-3 }
If these steps are not followed, your use of GenAI will be considered an **academic integrity violation**.
