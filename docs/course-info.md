## Assignments & Grading

### Projects (50% of total grade)
* üíª Programming projects serve as the bulk of our coursework, and will be completed/submitted through **Replit**, with grades/feedback posted on **BlackBaud**.
* Projects are graded on a 5-point scale, and **extra credit** is always available to encourage effort and creativity.
  * _See "Grading Rubric" section below._
* ‚è∞ **LATE WORK POLICY**: Late projects may only receive up to 75% credit if submitted UNDER one week late, or up to 50% credit if submitted OVER one week late.
  * Whenever you submit work after the assignment has been graded, you must SEND ME AN EMAIL, otherwise I will not be notified.
* üíØ **GRADE IMPROVEMENT POLICY**: You may re-submit projects for a full RE-GRADE, but you must email me to let me know which project, and it must be completed at least one week BEFORE the end of the current quarter.
  * When re-working your projects, you are encouraged to come to office hours for help or more feedback. I am way more likely to grade your work favorably if you've shown effort towards improving your skills...
  * Coding is an iterative process which means it is VERY normal not to have your programs working perfectly the first time! Programmers often have to edit their code many times.

<summary><strong>PROJECT GRADING RUBRIC</strong></summary>

<p class="fs-3 highlight">Programming projects are evaluated via a qualitative system considering a program‚Äôs efficiency, legibility, correctness, completeness, comments, etc. This rubric employs a 5-point scale. The assignment score is then adjusted to be out of 10 points, such that students earn a baseline of 50% credit for submitted work. Extra credit may be awarded for exceptional effort!</p>

### Homework (30% of total grade)
* üí¨ Homework will be assigned in the form of a "**CodeCollab**": like posting on a discussion board, but with a shared goal of figuring out how some üîç mystery code üîç works.
* **Due weekly on FRIDAYS @11:59pm**‚ùó
  * At the beginning of each week, I will **post a DISCUSSION assignment on BlackBaud** that includes a Replit link to a working program that you will **analyze collaboratively**.
    * All of the CodeCollab programs can also be found on my Replit profile page: [replit.com/@katerinanavab](replit.com/@katerinanavab)
  * To earn full credit, you must post **at least two (2) comments**: one standalone, and one response to a classmate.
  * CodeCollabs will be reviewed together during the first class period of the following week.
* ‚è∞ **LATE WORK POLICY**: Late homework may only receive up to 75% credit if submitted UNDER one week late, or up to 50% credit if submitted OVER one week late.
  * Whenever you submit work after the assignment has been graded, you must SEND ME AN EMAIL, otherwise I will not be notified.

### Participation (20% of total grade)
* üë• Participation is graded weekly (up to 2 points max per class period) and will be evaluated based on adherence to these key values: being **respectful**, **prepared**, and **engaged**.
  * Being **respectful** of your community means being mindful of and kind toward your environment, and the people within ‚Äì this includes arriving on-time to commitments.
    * ‚è∞ If you are over 5 minutes late, you must first get a LATE PASS from the Upper School Office and then enter the classroom QUIETLY as to not disrupt the class.
    * **GRADING**: Unexcused lateness always results in a deduction of 1 point for the day, and unexcused absence results in a deduction of 2 points (a 0/2 for the day).
  * Being **prepared** for class means you have your laptop ready (unless otherwise instructed) within the first 5 minutes of class. It also means you arrive with a positive attitude and are ready to learn!
  * Show you are **engaged** by volunteering answers/comments, staying on task, and completing classwork as directed. You are expected to take your own notes while new material is being introduced, to contribute during group activities, and be open to collaborating with all classmates.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **NON-NEGOTIABLES**: Be aware that tardiness, off-task behavior, and side conversations will have a negative impact on your grade. _However, arriving on-time with a positive attitude is a great way to earn an easy 100% for your participation grade_ ‚ò∫Ô∏é

## Expectations & Policies

### AI Usage Policies
* TBD (To Be _Discussed_)

### Other Classroom Policies
* üóìÔ∏è **Office Hours / Extra Help** is held during <span style="color: mypurple;">7th period (1:00-1:45pm) any day of the week in Room #71</span>.
 
{: .note } ONLY IF you do not have 7th period free, then you may email me to schedule an appointment at a different time. _Include a list of your free periods in your email!_

* üìù You can leave a **sticky note on my desk** for anything you want me to remember to do. *Ex: ‚ÄúPlease re-grade my project‚Äù*
* üñäÔ∏è **Student supplies** (pens, pencils, sticky notes, etc.) will always be available to borrow, located up front by the whiteboard. No need to ask, but please return pens/pencils after class! 
* ü§û **SILENTLY SIGNAL** that you need to leave for the bathroom or water by holding up crossed fingers.
 * Just make sure I acknowledge you are leaving the room first!!! Wait for me to give a thumbs up üëç
* üì± **NO PHONES!** ‚Üí as per the new BWL Upper School policy, phones must be locked up downstairs while you are in classes. If you are caught with a cell phone in class, it will be confiscated immediately and you will be sent to the Upper School office. 
* üòä **Common courtesy** stuff:
  * Student actions that interfere with teaching or learning in the classroom will NOT be tolerated. Please do not spend your class time on distracting apps, having side conversations, or doing work for other classes. 
  * Respect others‚Äô property. Avoid touching or writing on anything that does not belong to you (including tables, books, teacher‚Äôs belongings, walls, etc.)
  * Please pick up after yourself, don't leave trash behind, and don't expect that other people (_like your teacher_) will clean up your messes.
* üß† Finally, some **mindset** tips: I strongly encourage you all to be proactive about your learning, embrace creativity, take responsibility for your work, and never be afraid to ask for help!!!
  * There are no bad questions, and chances are if you are wondering about it, someone else in the class is too! If you feel most comfortable waiting until after class, that is okay, but do keep communication open between us.
